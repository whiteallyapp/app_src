Racism is around you. You may not see it because you're white but that does not mean it is not happening. Listen to a story from a person of color today and trust their story.
Do Not Assume people of color think alike. We are not all the same.
Never guess people's race. We hate that.
Do not confuse people's country of origin. Shut up, and listen.
Africa is not a country. It is a continent! Do not talk about Africa like it's homogenous.
Never compare your skin tone with someone who is darker than you. Literally, no person of color wants to hear it.
Never ask a person of color about their country of heritage, we are not your educators.
Just because we're a person of color does not mean we're athletic.
Don't assume that just because we're Asian we're good at math.
Never believe stereotypes.

Racism is around you. You may not see it because you're white but that does not mean it is not happening. Listen to a story from a person of color today and trust their story.
Do Not Assume people of color think alike. We are not all the same.
Never guess people's race. We hate that.
Do not confuse people's country of origin. Shut up, and listen.
Africa is not a country. It is a continent! Do not talk about Africa like it's homogenous.
Never compare your skin tone with someone who is darker than you. Literally, no person of color wants to hear it.
Never ask a person of color about their country of heritage, we are not your educators.
Just because we're a person of color does not mean we're athletic.
Don't assume that just because we're Asian we're good at math.
Never believe stereotypes.
There is no safe place in America for a person of color. Let that sink in.
The pay gap between people of color and white people is greater than the gender pay gap.
Remember Ferguson
People of color are not criminals.
Say aloud to someone that "Black Lives Matter"
Having committed a crime is not justification for execution.
Re-examin your beliefs about "crime".
Law enforcement is a white, for profit, institution
Criminal "justice" is not.
Do not dismiss the link below. Don't let your white privilage dismiss marginalized groups.
Challenge one other person to be an ally today!
Save your comments and your white experience for yourself. Keep your mouth shut when you are listening to a marginalized person.
Do not invalidate the lived experience of any person of color
Never justify whiteness. You are guilty.
You have internal bias. Identify your bias, remove it. Now help your white freinds remove it too.
You are in the best position to correct your white friends.
If you are not vocally denouncing whiteness you are not an ally.
Make your vote count. Release the stranglehold of whiteness on politics.
